# Diabetes-Prediction-using-SML-models
• Performed feature engineering on Pima Indians diabetes dataset and trained several classification models such as Logistic 
Regression, Tree-Based Classifiers, KNN, SVM, Naive Bayes Classifier, and Neural Network to predict diabetes in patients.
• Improved accuracy of the best performing model by 12% with data sampling and hyperparameter tuning.
• Generalizability of the model was tested on Diabetes data from Frankfurt Hospital in Germany, yielding accuracy of 84%
